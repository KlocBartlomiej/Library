#RestApp
It's my first rest application. I used Spring MVC and Spring Data which served me to connect to the MySql database.
 In the future I will add tests, lombok and maybe a few more features.
The main point of existing of this repositorium is learning. 
It was supposed to be a full web app with frontend at the beginning, but I focused on backend.
